Predicting anemia in adult females in the US
#### What the project does? 
Using the National Health And Nutrition Examinaton Survey(NHANES) data for 2013/14, I want to build a model that could predict whether an adult American female suffers from anemia or not. I will be using only some of the demographic information from this survey in building the model. 

#### Why the project is useful?
This project could help predict whether an adult female would suffer from anemia or not after recording some of her demographic information. This model could help both the individuals who want to monitor their hemoglobin level as well as the medical professionals have a primary prediction about anemia status of their patients.  This model can give a basic idea about hemoglobin level of the person (up to 85% prediciton accuracy) without drawing blood and testing it in the medical laboratory. 

##### Target vector: Anemia

'According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anemia is defined as `hemoglobin (Hb)` levels `<12.0 g/dL` in women and `<13.0 g/dL` in men.

##### Features (independent variables):

age, height, weight, education, race, family income to poverty ratio,dominant hand, arm circumference, arm lenghth in cm,	leg length in cm,  waist circumference
