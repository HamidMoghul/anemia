Predicting anemia in adult females in the US
============================================
# What the project does? 
Using the National Health And Nutrition Examinaton Survey data for 2013/14, I want to build a model that could predict whether an adult American female suffers from anemia or not. I will be using only some of the demographic information from this survey in building the model.
